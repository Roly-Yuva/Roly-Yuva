Hello! I am Roly-Yuva, and I currently do programming stuff as a hobby but I plan to get something like a computer science degree and turn it into a job one day.
But, my skills are not the best, but that's fine.
I mainly use C# and Lua, but I am interested in learning other languages such as Rust, Dart, and Nim. I also like to try and do some stuff in C/C++, although C++ still kinda scares me.
I mainly make little command line apps, such as a minesweeper clone I made in C#.
I would be happy to collaborate on anything that involves game development and stuff like that.
